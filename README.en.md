A video evidence tool for e-commerce packing stations. Scan a shipping barcode to start recording, then find the video later by tracking number for order verification and after-sales disputes.

## Who It Is For

- Packing stations that need hands-free video recording
- Sellers who need to retrieve video quickly by tracking number
- Teams that want spoken buyer messages, seller notes, or product information
- Warehouses that need video playback from phones or other computers on the LAN
- Users who want to trim the beginning or end of a recording before downloading it
- Computers with limited storage that need automatic cleanup while reserving free disk space

## Main Features

- Starts recording automatically when a shipping barcode is scanned
- Supports camera recording, audio capture, and video watermarks
- Searches recordings by order or tracking number and plays them in a browser
- Provides browser-based trim-and-download with a selectable time range
- Announces order notes and product information with text-to-speech
- Checks post-print refund status asynchronously after scanning and raises status-specific alerts in both shipping and return modes without interrupting recording
- Supports multiple storage locations, automatic drive switching, and reserve-space-based cleanup
- Checks for updates through the launcher, verifies incremental packages, and installs pending updates on the next launch

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 x64
- USB camera
- Barcode scanner configured as a keyboard input device

The portable release normally includes the required .NET runtime and `ffmpeg.exe`. Running from source or developing the project requires the .NET 8 SDK and `ffmpeg.exe` (the Full build is recommended).

## Quick Start

1. Open the application and go to Settings.
2. Select the camera and microphone.
3. Choose recording locations and the amount of disk space to reserve for the system.
4. Scan a shipping tracking number to start recording.
5. Finish the shipment or scan the stop command to end recording.
6. Enter the tracking number in the recording list whenever you need to retrieve the video.

## LAN Playback

1. Enable the Web service in Settings.
2. Save the settings and restart the application.
3. On another device in the same LAN, open `http://COMPUTER_IP:5280`.

Allow network access if Windows Firewall prompts you.

## Order Note Announcements

This feature uses the included browser userscript:

1. Install Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey.
2. Install `Scripts/快递助手订单推送.user.js` from this repository.
3. When the printing page opens or its orders change, the script sends the current order information to the monitoring workstation automatically. Normal order syncing does not depend on the refund worker page.
4. The monitoring workstation can announce buyer messages, seller notes, and product information.
5. To enable post-print refund alerts, keep one signed-in Kuaidi Assistant batch-printing page open. The script opens a background refund verification worker without taking focus. Only this worker changes the official post-print-refund filter; the page being used by the operator is not changed.
6. After a scan, recording starts immediately while refund data is requested asynchronously. The worker first returns the current refund list. If the tracking number is absent, it performs an exact historical lookup. When the printing workstation is offline or the lookup fails, the monitor falls back to order data retained in SQLite for 90 days.

The refund worker has a dedicated title and translucent overlay. Do not operate it manually. If it is closed accidentally, the script recreates it automatically; it can also be reopened from the userscript menu.

When the userscript connects to a new monitor address for the first time, the browser may request cross-origin access. Confirm that the destination is the local computer or a trusted LAN workstation before allowing it. Reinstalling the script through the monitor's setup guide adds an exact permission for the current workstation.

Duplicate tracking numbers are checked against non-deleted recording records from the last 30 days, independently of the browser cache. Order and refund caches are stored in SQLite. The legacy `orderinfo_cache.json` file is migrated during an upgrade and removed afterward.

## Recording Storage

Configuration, databases, logs, and recordings are stored in the current user's local data directories. Existing settings and recording records are preserved during normal upgrades as long as the user data is not deleted.

Storage settings represent reserved free space, not a recording quota. When a drive falls below its reserve threshold, the application stops writing new recordings to that drive and prefers the next configured location. The system drive automatically receives a larger safety reserve to protect Windows and other applications.
